                <li className="list-group-item">I am a dedicated third-year Computer Science student currently enrolled in the 3CS-B program at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao. 
                    My passion for technology drives my academic pursuits, as I strive to deepen my understanding of programming, data structures, and software development. 
                    I am particularly interested in exploring innovative solutions and contributing to projects that harness technology for positive change.
                    In addition to my studies, I serve as a manager at All-Day Midnight, a thriving thrift shop located in Pulo, Cabuyao. 
                    This venture, which is operated by my close friends and me, has allowed me to apply my leadership skills and business acumen in a real-world setting. 
                    My role involves overseeing daily operations, managing inventory, and implementing marketing strategies to enhance our reach within the community.
                    I am committed to continuous improvement, both academically and professionally, and I believe in the importance of balancing education with practical experience. 
                    Through my studies and my role at All-Day Midnight, I aim to develop skills that will empower me to make meaningful contributions to both the tech industry and local entrepreneurship.
